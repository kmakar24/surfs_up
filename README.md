## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if opening up a surf shop is a good idea. There are worries it may be too seasonal, so we are going to look into tempature trends in Oahu for the months of June and December to see if opening a surf and ice cream shop can be sustainable year-round. 

## Results 

Below are some differences I noticed from my analysis between June and December: 

1. Decembers min and max really differ where June does not have as dirastic min and max. So the December weather is most likely a lot more unpredictable. 
2. Both do have similar standard deviation though so they do have close to similar variations to the mean. 
3. June weather, even the min, is ice cream weather in my mind but December you might have a few days that are so cold no one wants ice cream but it does not seem to be an everyday thing just a few random cold days. 

## Summary 

In conclusion I do not think this is even close to enough information to determine if you should open the shop but I do think it is a good start. Here is my reasoning 
 
 - Is Oahu a tourist spot or is it more locals? If so need to look into tourist seasons. 
 - What is Oahu known for? I know when people visit Hawaii they think of Acia Bowls, very well known for that so I feel people would want that over ice cream. 
 - If I were them I would look into other businesses already in that area and than do some research into business that have closed within the past 5 years and why.
